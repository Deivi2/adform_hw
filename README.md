Its simply create-react-app application.

```bash
Please run npm install,

After installing node modules

Just run development server on port 3000 with: npm run start

```

Didn't had much time to write unit tests
But if something is missing in actual implementation please inform me and I will be happy to add it.

Thank you.
Have a nice day.
